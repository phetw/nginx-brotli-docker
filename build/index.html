              <p>
                Hello, friend. Hello, friend? That's lame... I suspect you did
                not come here by accident, right? I mean come on, what are the
                odds? The universe is vast and the internet is quite big as
                well, so my assumption is that you can speak English and
                somebody (man or machine) pointed you in the right direction to
                reach this page. So, you want to know about
                <strong>mini.css</strong>, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                I'll give you the elevator pitch and then you can decide if you
                want to stay or leave. So,
                <a href="http://minicss.org">mini.css</a> is a CSS framework
                (yes, another one) that tries to bridge the gap between
                micro-frameworks and full-featured UI toolkits. It's similar to
                things like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Foundation etc,
                <strong>but</strong> it's a lot lighter, more modern (based on
                Flexbox) and easily customizable. It's responsive, it doesn't
                use any Javascript, it's actively maintained, what else is there
                that you could possibly ask for? Oh, did I mention it has some
                default themes you can try out without getting your hands dirty?
                Yes, we call them
                <a href="http://minicss.org/flavors.html">flavors</a>!
              </p>

              <p>
                While <strong>mini.css</strong> provides some
                <a href="http://minicss.org/templates.html">templates</a> to get
                started, they're not as good as a full-fledged website. If only
                there was a platform to create such a sample website. Oh, wait,
                there is! What was it called again? Ah, yeah,
                <strong>Codepen projects</strong>! Thus, this project was
                conjured out of thin air to better showcase what
                <strong>mini.css</strong> can do. But before we get started, I
                need to show you something really important - some pictures of
                goats!

              <h2>What was that? <small>Goats, really?</small></h2>
              <p>
                While that might have been a bit unorthodox, the goats above
                were really important to this presentation. Why? Just look at
                them! Not them, <em>them</em>... Okay, I see why you are
                confused. I mean the cards where the goat pictures and my
                efforts to make you laugh at them are! These cards are part of
                the framework, along with pretty much everything else you see on
                this page (except for the goats, I borrowed those). As you can
                see, cards can be used to display media and text and create
                modern, responsive layouts. By the way,
                <strong>mini.css</strong> provides a pretty convenient grid
                system, as well. You can see it in action on this page and, as
                an added bonus, I will throw in a little tiled grid
                <del>of goat pictures</del> to show you what it looks like.

                So, you stayed for the whole presentation. But, wait! There's a
                lot more where that came from. I cannot show you everything
                here, <strong>but</strong> you can take a minute to check the
                other two pages in this project. You will find links in the
                header at the top of your window. If they're not there, you are
                probably on a mobile device and you should click on the little
                &quot;hamburger&quot; menu icon to see the menu and then click
                on one of the links to go to another page. Why do we call them
                hamburger menus anyways? Now I'm hungry... I should go get
                myself a burger. While I'm away, you can also check the
                framework's official <a href="http://minicss.org">website</a> to
                learn more about it. See you around!
